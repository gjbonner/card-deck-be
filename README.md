This is the back end portion of a deck of cards application. Users can create, delete and draw cards from decks.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repo and run ```bundle install``` to install necessary packages. Update any gems in the ```Gemfile``` if necessary.

Once done, create your database with ```rails db:create``` and migrate with ```rails db:migrate```

You're now ready to go! Go ahead and start your server with ```rails s``` this must be done before starting your front end as it needs to run on port 3000.
